# NewTab
[My new tab page](https://thev360.github.io/NewTab) - Not finished, but it looks cool right now!

# Features
* Fade effects
* Gradient backgrounds for fast loading
* Random backgrounds (there's a whopping three of them!)
* Clock
	* Military time support
	* You can show the Date too if you want, it shows up in the search box.
	* Date can be long
* Search bar
	* (open the search in a new tab by holding down shift)
	* (or just middle clicking the search button and then left clicking it)
* Simple premade bookmarks (for now)
* Ton of color themes

# Future plans
* Customizable icons
* Customizable random background
* Refactor everything, it looks good but it's impossible to style.
* Clock mode: nothing but the time in the center of the screen. (May not do this?)
